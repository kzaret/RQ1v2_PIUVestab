### Coring height corrections:  regressions of ring counts on height along stem for harvested cross section.  To be used to estimate rings not captured due to coring height of cores.

# Data:  harvested PIUV from all patches; pot_outlier = 1 if had been removed based on linear regressions and/or abnormal ring counts in consecutive rounds.

#Re Bog forest outliers:  For linear regression, had removed BF0802 entirely [9 cross sections] due to nonlinear growth pattern that differs from the rest of the harvested trees.  Itâ€™s also one of the older BF trees. Removed cross-sections 06, 05 and 04 from BF0902 (bc ring counts of 92, 91, 90 and 90 in a row and notes re 04 being rotten and may want to leave out). Removed ff bc high on stem and no cross sections in between:  BF0303_110to112, BF0305_100to102. Removed BF0202 [5 cross sections]. Removed BF0301_110to112.
